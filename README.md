  <h1>Eco-Friendly Shop</h1>
<P>
The web today is like Main Street of old. it's the busy hub where customers gather, compare prodcuts, and connect with businnesses around the world. Just like how a storefront on the town's central avenue draws lots of traffic and community rush, a well-crafted wesbite brings global visibility, instant feedback, and 24/7 accessibility-making "Main Street" limitless and borderless.
