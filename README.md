  <h1>How the web is today's "Main Street</h1>
<P>
The web today is like the "Main Street" in our society today. This is simply becuase it's the busy hub where customers gather, compare prodcuts, and connect with businnesses around the world. While this is happening, these costumers are using "Ip adresses." this can be thought of as like a phone number and is how computers find each other but of course this is something they can't remember easily. This is why they would just use domain names like "github.com" which are more memorbale names rather than using string numbers. DNS would be the global system that connects to dots, which translates the names we know into ip adrasses behind the scences. Now a domain is more than just a tech tool, but actually part of your brand, like a digtial storefront. A short, catchy domain tends to stick in costumers minds and helps your buisness grow.
